        Java, Martial Arts and Music:<br />
        the Perfect Blend</strong></p>
        <p class="smaller centered no-top-margin">by Lindsey Mullikin</p>
        <p class="smallerer med-lines">WHILE CHATTING WITH A BANK TELLER about the lack of coffee shops along Airport Boulevard, Thomas Gohring came up with what he thought was a kick-butt idea. Merging his love of martial arts (he also owns Master Gohring's Tai Chi &amp; Kung Fu ) with the community's need for a little pick-me-up, he opened Kick Butt Coffee Music &amp; Booze [February 11, 2008].</p>
        <p class="smallerer med-lines">Red walls, nunchuckus, bamboo and oriental fans illustrate the business ties to martial arts. The shop, which serves coffee, smoothies, pizza, breakfast frittatas, sandwiches, wine, beer and liquor, has round, cozy booths, a giant plasma screen TV and a Wii gaming system. Amenities at the new 2nd location include a giant projection screen, a swimming pool and a Wii.</p>
        <p class="smallerer med-lines">But Gohring wanted to build more of a nighttime business with a full bar as well. He asked his sister Joy, a stand-up comedian, to help start a weekly open mic night, and Kick Butt Comedy was born. The small coffee shop even opened its stage to over a 100 out-of-town musicians, including John Biz, Aim Low Kid and Christopher Denny, during South by Southwest.</p>
        <p class="smallerer med-lines">Gohring built off that music foundation with regular blues fusion dance nights, weekly open mic music, monthly Jazz Jam, and monthly belly dancing and drumming as well as regular hip-hop shows and rock concerts. While martial arts, coffee, comedy and music events may seem like random patchwork, it's all tied together with a single thread, Gohring explains. "It kind of boils down to one question that we ask ourselves every step of the way: Is it kick-butt?"</p>

        <p class="centered smallerer med-lines"><strong>With a name like Kick Butt, you'd</strong> think the atmosphere in this coffeehouse would lean toward assertive -- or at least jittery. 'Kick back' is far more descriptive. Unpretentious and un-corporate, Kick Butt Coffee Music &amp; Booze is the creation of Austin's renowned Tai Chi and Kung Fu master, Thomas Gohring. Here <strong>you're</strong> just as likely to bump into artists, musicians and poets as <strong>you</strong> are entrepreneurs, office workers and bean counters.</p>
        <p class="centered smallerer med-lines">The art of latte-making has been mastered. Deliciously original “sammiches” named for legends like Jackie Chan are featured on the menu. And don't resist treating <strong>yourself</strong> to the “Ying Yang” white and black chocolate cake.</p>
        <p class="centered smallerer med-lines">Kick Butt Coffee Music &amp; Booze has earned its well-deserved black belt in mouth-watering fare and entertaining yet relaxed ambience. The only thing <strong>you'll</strong> have to fight here is the impulse to sip, eat and linger all day and night." - Magic 95 FM</p>

        <p class="smallerer med-lines">Thomas Gohring teaches his <a href="http://mastergohring.com/kungfuaustin.html" target="_blank">Kung Fu</a> and <a href="http://mastergohring.com/taichiaustin.html" target="_blank">Tai Chi</a> students that energy, like fire, seeks something to burn. Gohring's students harness their energy by kicking, sparring and meditating. Gohring, a sixth-degree black sash master of Kung Fu, burns off his energy in other ways.<br /><br />The 37-year-old fireball [now 41] is always seeking his next challenge--whether it is opening his own Kung Fu and Tai Chi school or building his own coffee shop from scratch.<br /><br />The native Austinite first began Kung Fu when he was 14, and eventually took over mentoring new students in his teachers' classes. He began teaching Kung Fu professionally in his backyard, and opened his own school on Airport Boulevard in 1996.<br /><br />"Watching Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan movies (as a kid) I thought, 'I want to do that,' " Gohring says. "But after a year or so training, there was some talent noticed in me. Not necessarily for my capabilities in martial arts, but for my capabilities in communicating. I've now learned to call it tuning in to what's going on with someone."</p>

        <p  class="smallerer med-lines">It's that intuitiveness and passion that has set Gohring and his school apart. "He's identified that people learn in different ways," says Mary Grabhorn, an Assistant Instructor at Master Gohring's school. "He has a talent for very politely and concisely making a student feel comfortable."<br /><br />Gohring says that people seek out Kung Fu and Tai Chi for various reasons. Some enjoy the physical fitness and meditative outlet it provides. Others are admittedly in it for the thrill of learning how to wield nunchuckus.<br /><br />But no matter their motives, Master Gohring's school (which includes four instructors) helps them all, with a special focus on beginners and people with learning difficulties or physical handicaps. Some 200 students, ranging in age from four to 79 years old, choose from 30-plus classes each week. Master Gohring's also has become popular for entire families who learn Kung Fu and Tai Chi together.<br /><br />"It's not what <strong>you</strong> get to do. It's what <strong>you</strong> get to become." Grabhorn says about the process of learning Tai Chi and Kung Fu. "It really adds to people's lives."</p>
